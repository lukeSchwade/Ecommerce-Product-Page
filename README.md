## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

- How to create icons and use them as a fontsheet (NOT A FAN)
- How to import fonts online via google's font API (You don't need to declare font face when importing as it's already done)
- How to create an object associated with each item in the cart that stores important keys and has associated eventlisteners
- Dropdown menu implementation in CSS
- Implementation of a gallery lightbox using JS
- You can use Chrome Devtools to create a live-expression which is incredible for bugfixing and keeping track of variables
- The horrors of weakly typed languages

### Continued development

I'm really interested in the underlying mechanics of how the server communicates with client when doing something like a shop, and when, going to explore that although that's in the realm of non-static I guess.
